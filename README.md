# -Analysis-of-Netflix-TV-Shows-Genre-Seasons
This is my first project. I would love to hear your thoughts, and any constructive criticism will be taken into account for my future work. I am exploring the world of data analysis and want to focus my path on data science. Thank you for contributing!

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the titles.csv dataset, aiming to explore the ratings of TV series. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, the goal is to derive meaningful insights to determine whether the genre and the number of seasons influence the IMDb scores of these series. Additionally, the project seeks to identify the characteristics a new series should have to achieve a rating between 5 and 8 points
